# Word-Guess-Game

Sonic the Hedgehog themed word guess game. Built with HTML, CSS, Javasctipt, and jQuery.

## Instructions
* Similar to hangman, the game's objective is to guess the word correctly before you run out of guesses! 
* Start by clicking on a letter displayed below the dashed line.
* The dashed line indicates how many letters are in the word.
* By clicking a letter, this will indicate whether the letter is in the word or not.
* If so, it is added to the dashed line in the correct spot, or added to the guessed letters section.
* If you've guessed all the correct letters with guesses remainging you have won.
* If not, you have lost.
* A play again button appears once you've completed a round.
* Gif's are displayed for visual effects.
